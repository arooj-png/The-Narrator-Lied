# The-Narrator-Lied
The Narrator Lied is an AI-powered ghost story analyzer inspired by an e-novel where the user gets dropped into a haunted narrative. It detects mood, tone, character archetype, and predicts eerie continuations;  because in this story, the narrator can’t be trusted.

**What if the voice telling your story wasn’t honest?**

## 👻 Inspired By...

This project was directly inspired by an e-novel where the protagonist gets dropped into a ghost story and from that moment, everything becomes uncertain: the rules, the danger, and even the narrator.

## 💡 What It Does

When you input a story excerpt, the AI will:

- 🧠 **Detect the Mood and Tone**  
  Example: *eerie, vengeful, romantic, hopeless*

- 🧍 **Identify the Main Character Archetype**  
  Example: *The Doomed Artist, The Haunted Lover, The Reluctant Hero*

- 🔮 **Predict What Might Happen Next**  
  Example: *"The door opened, but no one had knocked."*

- 🕯️ **Generate a Short, Spooky Continuation**  
  The narrator *always* has something to say.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (core logic)
- **Flask** (backend)
- **Gemini API** (for natural language analysis and generation)
- **HTML/CSS** (minimal frontend)
